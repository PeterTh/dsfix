22-09-2012 -- version 1.5 beta
==============================
Bugfixes:
- fixed issue with SSAO being rendered on top of particle effects/fog/water, instead of below them

  (may fix random display corruption issue)
- tweaked SSAO a bit
New features:
- Can load .dds texture overrides in addition to .png
- Can set the desired target FPS of the game in the .ini, thanks to Clément Barnier!
  (This now also works correctly together with the intro skip feature)

04-09-2012 -- version 0.9 alpha

01-09-2012 -- version 0.8 alpha
===============================
- DSfix is now a Direct Input wrapper instead of a d3d9.dll wrapper
  this was done to fix the optimus issue, and it should also allow people to use 
  other wrappers for postprocessing effects
- there is a new setting "dinput8dllWrapper" which allows you to use additional
  DirectInput wrappers on top of DSfix should you so desire
- the way logging was handled when disabled has been improved, so you could see
  slightly improved performance in CPU limited situations with "logLevel 0" (the default)

  no longer nearly as invasive
