01-09-2012 -- version 0.8 alpha

  this was done to fix the optimus issue, and it should also allow people to use 
  other wrappers for postprocessing effects
- there is a new setting "dinput8dllWrapper" which allows you to use additional
  DirectInput wrappers on top of DSfix should you so desire
