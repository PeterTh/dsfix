01-09-2012 -- version 0.8 alpha
===============================
- DSfix is now a Direct Input wrapper instead of a d3d9.dll wrapper
  this was done to fix the optimus issue, and it should also allow people to use 
  other wrappers for postprocessing effects
- there is a new setting "dinput8dllWrapper" which allows you to use additional
  DirectInput wrappers on top of DSfix should you so desire
- the way logging was handled when disabled has been improved, so you could see
  slightly improved performance in CPU limited situations with "logLevel 0" (the default)
